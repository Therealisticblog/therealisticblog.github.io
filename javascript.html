             <p>The course intruducted JavaScript and started off by showing how to code an alert. As the lessosn went on they eventually showed how to add a passowrd to a webpage.</p>
             <p>I thought about doing a password protected page for this website to practise the skills I'd learnt. However, as I'd only just done this as part of the course ,and had lots of notes on it, I thought I would give something else a go.</p>
             <p>Therefore, I decided I wanted to try and use JavaScript to switch my website from 'Dark mode' to 'Light mode.'
             </p>
             <p>The button below should (hopefully) allow you to turn this page to light mode. I'm still very much a beginner and so it isn't perfect. It only changes this page and although the text and styling on the button changes to a 'Dark Mode' button you can't click it again to get back to dark mode. The only way to reset it is to refresh the page.</p>
             <button class="centre" id="button" onclick="lightmode()">Light Mode</button>
